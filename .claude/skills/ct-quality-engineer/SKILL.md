description: Multi-dimension QE Agent that validates Cho Tot iOS features against a PRD/document AND technical standards. Provide your PRD (text, file path, or URL notes) and implementation path. Spawns parallel subagents — one reads the PRD to extract acceptance criteria and find functional bugs, others audit architecture, CTDesignSystem, RxSwift, tests, and localization. Produces a structured bug report. Use before opening a PR or before a release.

# Cho Tot iOS — Quality Engineer (PRD-Aware, Multi-Agent)

## Overview

This skill acts as a **QE Orchestrator** that validates your feature from **two angles**:

1. **Functional Validation** — Does the implementation match what the PRD/document specified?
2. **Technical Validation** — Does the code follow Cho Tot's architecture, UI, and coding standards?

```
QE Orchestrator (this skill)
├── 📋  Business Requirements Agent  → reads PRD → extracts AC → finds functional bugs
├── 🏗️  Architecture Agent           → MVVM layers, DI, protocol separation
├── 🎨  UI Compliance Agent          → CTDesignSystem, SnapKit, theming, colors
├── ⚡  RxSwift Agent                → subscriptions, memory, schedulers, operators
├── 🧪  Test Coverage Agent          → Quick/Nimble specs, mocks, edge cases
└── 🌏  Localization Agent           → CTLocalize patterns, hardcoded strings
```

The **Business Requirements Agent is the most important** — it tells you if the feature works as specified, not just if it's technically well-written.

---

## Input Format

```
PRD: [Paste the PRD/document content inline, OR provide a file path to a .md/.txt file]
TARGET: [File path or folder — e.g. AppFeatures/CTReward/CTReward/Features/Voucher]
SCOPE: [file | feature | module]
DIMENSIONS: [functional, architecture, ui, rxswift, tests, localization — or "all"]
```

### PRD Input Options

| Option | Example |
|---|---|
| Inline text | `PRD: Users can view a list of vouchers. Tapping a voucher applies it to checkout...` |
| File path | `PRD: ./docs/voucher-feature.md` |
| Section paste | `PRD: [paste content from Notion/Confluence/Figma]` |

**At minimum, provide:**
- Feature name and purpose
- User stories or acceptance criteria
- Expected UI behavior (screens, states, interactions)
- API contracts if known
- Edge cases explicitly stated in the document

---

## Orchestrator Execution Protocol

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps **exactly**:

### Step 1 — Load PRD

If PRD is a file path → read the file. If inline text → use as-is.

Extract and list the following before launching agents:
```
Feature Name: ...
User Stories found: N
Acceptance Criteria found: N
UI States mentioned: [...] 
Edge Cases mentioned: [...]
API Endpoints mentioned: [...]
```

### Step 2 — Discover Implementation Files

Read the TARGET path and identify all relevant Swift files:
- `*ViewController.swift` — Presentation layer
- `*ViewModel.swift` — Presentation logic
- `*UseCase.swift` — Domain / business logic
- `*Repository.swift` — Data access abstraction
- `*Service.swift` — Network / data services
- `*Target.swift` — API targets
- `*Spec.swift` / `*Tests.swift` — Unit tests
- `*Cell.swift`, `*View.swift` — UI components

List all discovered files before proceeding.

### Step 3 — Launch All Subagents in Parallel

Launch all dimension agents simultaneously using the Agent tool in a single message.

Pass every subagent:
- The **full PRD content** (for context)
- The **full contents of all discovered Swift files**
- Their **specific checklist** (see below)
- The **required JSON output format**

### Step 4 — Aggregate and Output Final Report

Merge all subagent results into the Final QA Report format below. Never summarize — show every bug and issue with file path and line number.

## Subagent Checklists

### 📋 Business Requirements Agent

You are a **senior QA engineer** who validates that iOS implementations match their product requirements.

You have been given:
- A **PRD or feature document** describing what the feature should do
- The **Swift source files** implementing that feature

Your job is to:

**Step 1 — Extract Acceptance Criteria**

Read the PRD and extract every testable requirement. Number them. For each one, write it as a concrete, verifiable statement:

```
AC-1: User sees a list of available vouchers when opening the screen
AC-2: Each voucher shows title, discount value, and expiry date
AC-3: Expired vouchers are shown in a separate section or greyed out
AC-4: Tapping a voucher navigates to voucher detail
AC-5: Empty state shows "Bạn chưa có voucher nào" when no vouchers available
AC-6: Loading indicator shown while fetching
AC-7: Error state shown with retry button on network failure
...
```

If the PRD doesn't have explicit AC, derive them from user stories, UI descriptions, and business rules.

**Step 2 — Validate Each AC Against Implementation**

For each AC, read the Swift files and determine:

- `✅ IMPLEMENTED` — code clearly handles this requirement
- `⚠️ PARTIAL` — code partially handles it (e.g. loading state exists but no retry button)
- `❌ MISSING` — no code found handling this requirement
- `🐛 WRONG` — code exists but behavior contradicts the PRD

**Step 3 — Generate Functional Bug List**

For every MISSING, WRONG, or PARTIAL requirement, create a bug entry:

```
BUG-001 [CRITICAL] Missing empty state
  Requirement (AC-5): Empty state should show "Bạn chưa có voucher nào"
  Found in code: No empty state view or condition found in VoucherListViewController
  Impact: Users see a blank screen when no vouchers are available
  Suggested fix: Add empty state DSLabel with localized text when datasource is empty

BUG-002 [CRITICAL] Error state has no retry button
  Requirement (AC-7): Error state must include a retry button
  Found in code: VoucherListViewModel.swift:45 — error relay exists but ViewController only shows a toast
  Impact: Users cannot recover from network failures without restarting the app
  Suggested fix: Add DSButton retry action bound to fetchTrigger in error state view

BUG-003 [WARNING] Expiry date format may be wrong
  Requirement (AC-2): Each voucher shows expiry date
  Found in code: VoucherCell.swift:67 — expiryLabel.text = model.expiryDate (raw string, no formatting)
  Impact: Date format may not match Vietnamese locale expectations
  Suggested fix: Format with DateFormatter using vi_VN locale
```

**Severity Classification:**
- `CRITICAL` — Feature is broken or a core requirement is completely missing
- `WARNING` — Feature works but doesn't fully match the PRD
- `INFO` — Minor discrepancy or enhancement opportunity

**Output format:**
```json
{
  "dimension": "functional",
  "status": "PASS|WARN|FAIL",
  "score": 0-5,
  "acceptance_criteria_total": N,
  "implemented": N,

## Example Usage

### With inline PRD

```
PRD: 
  Feature: Voucher List
  - Users can see all available vouchers
  - Each voucher shows: title, discount value (e.g. "Giảm 50.000đ"), expiry date
  - Expired vouchers appear in a separate "Đã hết hạn" section
  - Tapping a voucher shows voucher detail bottom sheet
  - Empty state: "Bạn chưa có voucher nào" with an illustration
  - Loading skeleton shown while API call is in progress
  - On error: show error message + "Thử lại" retry button
  - API: GET /api/v1/vouchers — returns list of voucher objects

TARGET: AppFeatures/CTReward/CTReward/Features/Voucher
SCOPE: feature
DIMENSIONS: all
```

### With PRD file

```
PRD: ./docs/prd-voucher-feature.md
TARGET: AppFeatures/CTReward/CTReward/Features/Voucher
SCOPE: feature
DIMENSIONS: functional, ui, rxswift
```

### Quick functional-only check

```
PRD: [paste your PRD here]
TARGET: AppFeatures/CTChat/CTChat/Features/ChannelDetail
SCOPE: feature
DIMENSIONS: functional
```

---

## Quality Standards Reference

- **Architecture**: AGENTS.md — MVVM + Clean Architecture
- **UI**: CTDesignSystem (DSLabel, DSButton, DSTextField, DSImageView, SnapKit)
- **Reactive**: RxSwift 6 — BehaviorRelay, PublishRelay, DisposeBag
- **Tests**: Quick/Nimble — describe/context/it, mock protocols
- **Localization**: CTLocalize — [Module]Localize.[key]() pattern
- **Logging**: `Logger.print()` from CTCommon — never `print()`

❗️ **Important**: The Business Requirements Agent is the primary agent. Always provide a PRD or feature document — without it, functional validation cannot run. Technical agents can run independently if DIMENSIONS excludes "functional".
